src/assets/image.png [Replace with actual banner image]

🌟 Overview
A machine learning-powered web application that automatically classifies news articles into 4 categories: World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech. Built with Python and Streamlit, this project demonstrates:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
- Logistic Regression with TF-IDF
- Production-ready model deployment
- Modern UI/UX design principles

🚀 Key Features
🔍 Core Functionality
- Text Classification: Predicts news categories from headlines and content
- High Accuracy: ~90% accuracy on test data
- Fast Inference: Processes articles in milliseconds

🎨 User Experience
- Dark Mode Interface: Eye-friendly professional design
- Responsive Layout: Works on desktop and mobile
- Large Typography: Optimized for readability
- Clean Input/Output: Minimalist workflow

⚙️ Technical Highlights
- Custom text preprocessing pipeline
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Logistic Regression classifier
- Model persistence with Joblib
